A player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards, after which they may not take further mulligans. 103.5a In a Vanguard game, each playerâs starting hand size is seven plus or minus the hand modifier of their vanguard card. 103.5b If an effect allows a player to perform an action âany time [that player] could mulligan,â the player may perform that action at a time they would declare whether they will take a mulligan. This need not be in the first round of mulligans. Other players may have already made their mulligan declarations by the time the player has the option to perform this action. If the player performs the action, they then declare whether they will take a mulligan. 103.5c In a multiplayer game and in any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesnât count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal. 103.5d In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team declares whether that player will take a mulligan, then the players on each other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. A player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand."

Similarly, if an effect states a quality of that object (â[creature] canât be blocked,â for example), itâs neither granting an ability nor setting a characteristic. Example: Muraganda Petroglyphs reads, âCreatures with no abilities get +2/+2.â A Runeclaw Bear (a creature with no abilities) enchanted by an Aura that says âEnchanted creature has flyingâ would not get +2/+2. A Runeclaw Bear enchanted by an Aura that says âEnchanted creature is redâ or âEnchanted creature canât be blockedâ would get +2/+2."

    "content": "Damage is processed in a four-part sequence. 120.4a First, if an effect thatâs causing damage to be dealt states that excess damage that would be dealt to a permanent is dealt to another permanent or player instead, the damage event is modified accordingly. If the first permanent is a creature, the excess damage is the amount of damage in excess of what would be lethal damage, taking into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other sources that would be dealt at the same time. (See rule 120.6.) Any amount of damage greater than 1 is excess damage if the source dealing that damage to a creature has deathtouch. (See rule 702.2.) If the first permanent is a planeswalker, the excess damage is the amount of damage in excess of that planeswalkerâs loyalty, taking into account damage from other sources that would be dealt at the same time. If the first permanent is a battle, the excess damage is the amount of damage in excess of that battleâs defense, taking into account damage from other sources that would be dealt at the same time. If the first permanent has multiple card types from among the list of creature, planeswalker, and battle, the excess damage is the greatest of the calculated amounts for each of the card types it has. 120.4b Second, damage is dealt, as modified by replacement and prevention effects that interact with damage. (See rule 614, âReplacement Effects,â and rule 615, âPrevention Effects.â) Abilities that trigger when damage is dealt trigger now and wait to be put on the stack. 120.4c Third, damage thatâs been dealt is processed into its results, as modified by replacement effects that interact with those results (such as life loss or counters). 120.4d Finally, the damage event occurs. Example: A player who controls Boon Reflection, an enchantment that says âIf you would gain life, you gain twice that much life instead,â attacks with a 3/3 creature with wither and lifelink. Itâs blocked by a 2/2 creature, and the defending player casts a spell that prevents the next 2 damage that would be dealt to the blocking creature. The damage event starts out as [3 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. The prevention effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [1 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. Thatâs processed into its results, so the damage event is now [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 1 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Boon Reflectionâs effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 2 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Then the damage event occurs. Example: The defending player controls a creature and Worship, an enchantment that says âIf you control a creature, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.â That player is at 2 life, and is being attacked by two unblocked 5/5 creatures. The player casts Awe Strike, which says âThe next time target creature would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage. You gain life equal to the damage prevented this way,â targeting one of the attackers. The damage event starts out as [10 damage is dealt to the defending player]. Awe Strikeâs effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [5 damage is dealt to the defending player, the defending player gains 5 life]. Thatâs processed into its results, so the damage event is now [the defending player loses 5 life, the defending player gains 5 life]. Worshipâs effect sees that the damage event would not reduce the playerâs life total to less than 1, so Worshipâs effect is not applied. Then the damage event occurs.",

(See rule 614, âReplacement Effects,â and rule 615, âPrevention Effects.â) Abilities that trigger when damage is dealt trigger now and wait to be put on the stack. 120.4c Third, damage thatâs been dealt is processed into its results, as modified by replacement effects that interact with those results (such as life loss or counters). 120.4d Finally, the damage event occurs. Example: A player who controls Boon Reflection, an enchantment that says âIf you would gain life, you gain twice that much life instead,â attacks with a 3/3 creature with wither and lifelink. Itâs blocked by a 2/2 creature, and the defending player casts a spell that prevents the next 2 damage that would be dealt to the blocking creature. The damage event starts out as [3 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. The prevention effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [1 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. Thatâs processed into its results, so the damage event is now [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 1 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Boon Reflectionâs effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 2 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Then the damage event occurs. Example: The defending player controls a creature and Worship, an enchantment that says âIf you control a creature, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.â That player is at 2 life, and is being attacked by two unblocked 5/5 creatures. The player casts Awe Strike, which says âThe next time target creature would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage. You gain life equal to the damage prevented this way,â targeting one of the attackers. The damage event starts out as [10 damage is dealt to the defending player]. Awe Strikeâs effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [5 damage is dealt to the defending player, the defending player gains 5 life]. Thatâs processed into its results, so the damage event is now [the defending player loses 5 life, the defending player gains 5 life]. Worshipâs effect sees that the damage event would not reduce the playerâs life total to less than 1, so Worshipâs effect is not applied. Then the damage event occurs."

A name sticker on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes the word on that sticker to be added to the text of that objectâs name. This is a text-changing effect. See rule 613.1c and rule 612, âText-Changing Effects.â 123.6a For the purposes of rules and effects related to name stickers, a âwordâ in an objectâs name is any series of non-space characters that are separated from other non-space characters by one or more spaces. Hyphenated words and words with punctuation are considered to be one word. Blank lines, such as the one in âWolf in ________ Clothing,â are not considered words in a cardâs name. 123.6b As a name sticker is placed on an object, that objectâs controller chooses a position in that objectâs name for the word in the name sticker to be added, then announces that objectâs new name. That word can be added at the beginning of the objectâs name or after any number of the other words that are currently in its name. The new name can be further modified by other name stickers. If that object has no name, its name becomes the word added by the name sticker. Name stickers never modify or remove any of the other words in that name. Example: As a player puts a name sticker with the word âDarkâ printed on it onto a creature named Bear Cub, that creatureâs controller chooses whether its new name is âDark Bear Cub,â âBear Dark Cub,â or âBear Cub Dark.â They then announce the new name to all players. 123.6c The text that a name sticker is modifying may change due to other effects and/or a permanentâs face-down status (see rule 708, âFace-Down Spells and Permanentsâ). To determine the name of an object with one or more name stickers, start with the objectâs copiable values, then apply each name stickerâs effect and each other text-changing effect in timestamp order. The position of each name sticker will continue to be after the number of words that were before it in the objectâs name when it was placed. If there are fewer words in the objectâs current name, the word on that sticker is added at the end of its name instead. The position and timestamp order of each name sticker on an object is remembered as the object that sticker is on moves from one public zone to another, and it continues to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone (see rule 123.5). This is an exception to rule 400.7. Example: Fae of Wishes, an adventurer card, is in exile with a name sticker on it adding the word âManaâ after its second word, so its name is âFae of Mana Wishes.â An effect allows that player to cast Granted, its Adventure, from exile. The name of that spell on the stack is âGranted Mana.â After that card is exiled as the Adventure resolves, the stickerâs position (after the second word) is remembered, so the name of the exiled card is once again âFae of Mana Wishes.â Example: A player owns a creature named It That Betrays on the battlefield. Using name stickers, they add the word âEldraziâ to its name after the third word, such that its new name is âIt That Betrays Eldrazi.â Later, that creature becomes a copy of a creature named Seeker of the Way. The name sticker continues to apply after the third word, so its new name is âSeeker of the Eldrazi Way.â Example: A creature with a name sticker on it becomes enchanted by Witness Protection, an Aura that changes the creatureâs name to âLegitimate Businessperson.â Since Witness Protection is also a text-changing effect, and it has a later timestamp than the name sticker, the word on that name sticker is not part of the creatureâs name. Its name is âLegitimate Businessperson.â 123.6d Some effects refer to the number of one or more specific letters on a name sticker. A lowercase letter and its uppercase equivalent are the same letter. 123.6e Some effects refer to the number of âunique vowelsâ on a name sticker.

Example: A player controls Lilianaâs Contract, which says, in part, âAt the beginning of your upkeep, if you control four or more Demons with different names, you win the game.â That player controls three Demons with different names and a face-down creature with no name, with an effect making it a Demon. Because the four creatures include one with no name, those four creatures donât count as four Demons with different names. The ability of Lilianaâs Contract wonât trigger. 201.2c Some spells or abilities check if one object has a different name than a second object or group of objects. The first object has a different name than those objects if the first object has at least one name and has no names in common with any of the other objects, even if one or more of the other objects have no names. If the first object has no name, it does not have a different name than any of the other objects, even if those other objects themselves have names."

However, an object with either the instant or sorcery card type retains that type. Counters, stickers, effects, and damage marked on the object remain with it, even if they are meaningless to the new card type. Similarly, when an effect sets one or more of an objectâs subtypes, the new subtype(s) replaces any existing subtypes from the appropriate set (creature types, land types, artifact types, enchantment types, planeswalker types, or spell types). If an objectâs card type is removed, the subtypes correlated with that card type will remain if they are also the subtypes of a card type the object currently has; otherwise, they are also removed for the entire time the objectâs card type is removed. Removing an objectâs subtype doesnât affect its card types at all. 205.1b Some effects change an objectâs card type, supertype, or subtype but specify that the object retains a prior card type, supertype, or subtype.

This rule applies to effects that use phrases such as âin addition to its other typesâ or that state that something is âstill a [type, supertype, or subtype].â Some effects state that an object becomes an âartifact creatureâ; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes. Some effects state that an object becomes a â[creature type or types] artifact creatureâ; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes other than creature types, but replace any existing creature types. Example: An ability reads, âAll lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.â The affected lands now have two card types: creature and land. If there were any lands that were also artifacts before the abilityâs effect applied to them, those lands would become âartifact land creatures,â not just âcreatures,â or âland creatures.â The effect allows them to retain both the artifact and land card types. In addition, each land affected by the ability retains any land types and supertypes it had before the ability took effect. Example: An ability reads, âAll artifacts are 1/1 artifact creatures.â If a permanent is both an artifact and an enchantment, it will become an artifact enchantment creature.",
    "full_text": "Rule 205.1: The type line is printed directly below the illustration. It contains the cardâs card type(s). It also contains the cardâs subtype(s) and supertype(s), if applicable. 205.1a Some effects set an objectâs card type. In most such cases, the new card type(s) replaces any existing card types. However, an object with either the instant or sorcery card type retains that type. Counters, stickers, effects, and damage marked on the object remain with it, even if they are meaningless to the new card type. Similarly, when an effect sets one or more of an objectâs subtypes, the new subtype(s) replaces any existing subtypes from the appropriate set (creature types, land types, artifact types, enchantment types, planeswalker types, or spell types). If an objectâs card type is removed, the subtypes correlated with that card type will remain if they are also the subtypes of a card type the object currently has; otherwise, they are also removed for the entire time the objectâs card type is removed. Removing an objectâs subtype doesnât affect its card types at all. 205.1b Some effects change an objectâs card type, supertype, or subtype but specify that the object retains a prior card type, supertype, or subtype. In such cases, all the objectâs prior card types, supertypes, and subtypes are retained. This rule applies to effects that use phrases such as âin addition to its other typesâ or that state that something is âstill a [type, supertype, or subtype].â Some effects state that an object becomes an âartifact creatureâ; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes.

    "content": "Subtypes 205.3a A card can have one or more subtypes printed on its type line. 205.3b Subtypes of each card type except creature and plane are always single words and are listed after a long dash. Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Subtypes of creature cards are one or two words and are listed after a long dash. Each word or two-word phrase, as listed in rule 205.3m, is a separate subtype. Objects other than planes may have multiple subtypes. Subtypes of planes are also listed after a long dash, but may be multiple words; all words after the dash are, collectively, a single subtype. Example: âBasic Land â Mountainâ means the card is a land with the subtype Mountain. âCreature â Goblin Wizardâ means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard. âArtifact â Equipmentâ means the card is an artifact with the subtype Equipment. 205.3c If a card with multiple card types has one or more subtypes, each subtype is correlated to its appropriate card type. Example: Dryad Arborâs type line says âLand Creature â Forest Dryad.â Forest is a land type, and Dryad is a creature type. 205.3d An object canât gain a subtype that doesnât correspond to one of that objectâs types. 205.3e If an effect instructs a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose one, and only one, existing subtype, and the subtype must be for the appropriate card type. For example, the player canât choose a land type if an instruction requires choosing a creature type. Example: When choosing a creature type, âMerfolkâ or âWizardâ is acceptable, but âMerfolk Wizardâ is not. Words like âartifact,â âopponent,â âSwamp,â or âtruckâ canât be chosen because they arenât creature types. 205.3f Many cards were printed with subtypes that are now obsolete. Many cards have retroactively received subtypes. Use the Oracle card reference to determine what a cardâs subtypes are. (See rule 108.1.) 205.3g Artifacts have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called artifact types. The artifact types are Attraction (see rule 717), Blood, Bobblehead, Clue, Contraption, Equipment (see rule 301.5), Food, Fortification (see rule 301.6), Gold, Incubator, Infinity, Junk, Lander, Map, Powerstone, Spacecraft, Stone, Treasure, and Vehicle (see rule 301.7). 205.3h Enchantments have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called enchantment types. The enchantment types are Aura (see rule 303.4), Background, Cartouche, Case (see rule 719), Class (see rule 716), Curse, Role (see rule 303.7), Room, Rune, Saga (see rule 714), Shard, and Shrine. 205.3i Lands have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called land types. The land types are Cave, Desert, Forest, Gate, Island, Lair, Locus, Mine, Mountain, Plains, Planet, Power-Plant, Sphere, Swamp, Tower, Town, and Urzaâs. Of that list, Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, and Swamp are the basic land types. See rule 305.6. 205.3j Planeswalkers have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called planeswalker types.

Also, prior to the Sixth Edition core set, with the exception of the Simplified Chinese Fifth Edition core set, Magic core sets didnât have expansion symbols at all.)"

What an Aura can be attached to is defined by its enchant keyword ability (see rule 702.5, âEnchantâ). Other effects can limit what a permanent can be enchanted by. 303.4a An Aura spell requires a target, which is defined by its enchant ability. 303.4b The object or player an Aura is attached to is called enchanted. The Aura is attached to, or âenchants,â that object or player. 303.4c If an Aura is enchanting an illegal object or player as defined by its enchant ability and other applicable effects, the object it was attached to no longer exists, or the player it was attached to has left the game, the Aura is put into its ownerâs graveyard. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.) 303.4d An Aura canât enchant itself. If this occurs somehow, the Aura is put into its ownerâs graveyard. An Aura thatâs also a creature canât enchant anything. If this occurs somehow, the Aura becomes unattached, then is put into its ownerâs graveyard. (These are state-based actions. See rule 704.) An Aura canât enchant more than one object or player. If a spell or ability would cause an Aura to become attached to more than one object or player, the Auraâs controller chooses which object or player it becomes attached to. 303.4e An Auraâs controller is separate from the enchanted objectâs controller or the enchanted player; the two need not be the same. If an Aura enchants an object, changing control of the object doesnât change control of the Aura, and vice versa. Only the Auraâs controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Aura grants an ability to the enchanted object (with âgainsâ or âhasâ), the enchanted objectâs controller is the only one who can activate that ability. 303.4f If an Aura is entering the battlefield under a playerâs control by any means other than by resolving as an Aura spell, and the effect putting it onto the battlefield doesnât specify the object or player the Aura will enchant, that player chooses what it will enchant as the Aura enters the battlefield.

In the last case, the chaos ability can trigger even if that plane card is still in the planar deck but revealed. A chaos ability is controlled by the current planar controller."

    "content": "First, the active player declares attackers. This turn-based action doesnât use the stack. To declare attackers, the active player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 732, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ). 508.1a The active player chooses which creatures that they control, if any, will attack. The chosen creatures must be untapped, they canât also be battles, and each one must either have haste or have been controlled by the active player continuously since the turn began. 508.1b If the defending player controls any planeswalkers, is the protector of any battles, or the game allows the active player to attack multiple other players, the active player announces which player, planeswalker, or battle each of the chosen creatures is attacking. 508.1c The active player checks each creature they control to see whether itâs affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature canât attack, or that it canât attack unless some condition is met). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of attackers is illegal. Example: A player controls two creatures, each with a restriction that states âThis creature canât attack alone.â Itâs legal to declare both as attackers. 508.1d The active player checks each creature they control to see whether itâs affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature attacks if able, or that it attacks if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of attackers is illegal. If a creature canât attack unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if attacking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature attacks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature attacks if able during each declare attackers step in that turn.

If at any point during the declaration of attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 732, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ). 508.1a The active player chooses which creatures that they control, if any, will attack. The chosen creatures must be untapped, they canât also be battles, and each one must either have haste or have been controlled by the active player continuously since the turn began. 508.1b If the defending player controls any planeswalkers, is the protector of any battles, or the game allows the active player to attack multiple other players, the active player announces which player, planeswalker, or battle each of the chosen creatures is attacking. 508.1c The active player checks each creature they control to see whether itâs affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature canât attack, or that it canât attack unless some condition is met). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of attackers is illegal. Example: A player controls two creatures, each with a restriction that states âThis creature canât attack alone.â Itâs legal to declare both as attackers. 508.1d The active player checks each creature they control to see whether itâs affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature attacks if able, or that it attacks if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of attackers is illegal. If a creature canât attack unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if attacking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature attacks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature attacks if able during each declare attackers step in that turn.

(See rule 509.1g.) It wonât trigger if the creature is put onto the battlefield blocking. 509.3b An ability that reads âWhenever [a creature] blocks a creature, . . .â triggers once for each attacking creature the creature with the ability blocks. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if an effect causes that creature to block an attacking creature, but only if it wasnât already blocking that attacking creature at that time.

It will trigger if that creature becomes blocked by at least one creature declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes blocked by an effect or by a creature thatâs put onto the battlefield as a blocker, but only if the attacking creature was an unblocked creature at that time.

If an ability triggers when a creature becomes blocked by a creature with certain characteristics, it will trigger only if the latter creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocking creature. None of those abilities will trigger if the relevant creatureâs characteristics change to match the abilityâs trigger condition later on. Example: A creature has the ability âWhenever this creature becomes blocked by a white creature, destroy that creature at end of combat.â If the creature becomes blocked by a black creature that is later turned white, the ability will not trigger. 509.3g An ability that reads âWhenever [a creature] attacks and isnât blocked, . . .â triggers if no creatures are declared as blockers for that creature.

    "subsection": "601. Casting Spells",
    "content": "To cast a spell is to take it from where it is (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Casting a spell includes proposal of the spell (rules 601.2aâd) and determination and payment of costs (rules 601.2fâh). To cast a spell, a player follows the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legally allowed to cast the spell to begin this process (see rule 601.3). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while performing that step, the casting of the spell is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 732, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ). 601.2a To propose the casting of a spell, a player first moves that card (or that copy of a card) from where it is to the stack. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has all the characteristics of the card (or the copy of a card) associated with it, and that player becomes its controller. Any continuous effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as you start casting it begin as it is put on the stack (see rule 611.2f). The spell remains on the stack until it resolves, itâs countered, or a rule or effect moves it elsewhere. 601.2b If the spell is modal, the player announces the mode choice (see rule 700.2). If the player wishes to splice any cards onto the spell (see rule 702.47), they reveal those cards in their hand. If the spell has alternative or additional costs that will be paid as itâs being cast such as buyback or kicker costs (see rules 118.8 and 118.9), the player announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs (see rule 601.2f). A player canât apply two alternative methods of casting or two alternative costs to a single spell. If the spell has a variable cost that will be paid as itâs being cast (such as an {X} in its mana cost; see rule 107.3), the player announces the value of that variable. If the value of that variable is defined in the text of the spell by a choice that player would make later in the announcement or resolution of the spell, that player makes that choice at this time instead of that later time. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes hybrid mana symbols, the player announces the nonhybrid equivalent cost they intend to pay. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes Phyrexian mana symbols, the player announces whether they intend to pay 2 life or a corresponding colored mana cost for each of those symbols. Previously made choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard or choosing to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the playerâs options when making these choices. 601.2c The player announces their choice of an appropriate object or player for each target the spell requires. A spell may require some targets only if an alternative or additional cost (such as a kicker cost) or a particular mode was chosen for it; otherwise, the spell is cast as though it did not require those targets. Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spellâs text. Once the number of targets the spell has is determined, that number doesnât change, even if the information used to determine the number of targets does. The same target canât be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word âtargetâ on the spell. However, if the spell uses the word âtargetâ in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word âtargetâ (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects that say that an object or player canât be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or players each become a target of that spell. (Any abilities that trigger when those objects and/or players become the target of a spell trigger at this point; theyâll wait to be put on the stack until the spell has finished being cast.) Example: If a spell says âTap two target creatures,â then the same creature canât be chosen twice; the spell requires two different legal targets. A spell that says âDestroy target artifact and target land,â however, can target the same artifact land twice because it uses the word âtargetâ in multiple places. 601.2d If the spell requires the player to divide or distribute an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets, the player announces the division. Each of these targets must receive at least one of whatever is being divided. 601.2e The game checks to see if the proposed spell can legally be cast. If the proposed spell is illegal, the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 732, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ). 601.2f The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule 601.2b), plus all additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If multiple cost reductions apply, the player may apply them in any order. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It canât be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes âlocked in.â If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect. 601.2g If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule 605, âMana Abilitiesâ). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid. 601.2h The player pays the total cost. First, they pay all costs that donât involve random elements or moving objects from the library to a public zone, in any order. Then they pay all remaining costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed. Unpayable costs canât be paid. Example: You cast Altarâs Reap, which costs {1}{B} and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to cast. Because a spellâs total cost is âlocked inâ before payments are actually made, you pay {B}, not {1}{B}, even though youâre sacrificing the Familiar. 601.2i Once the steps described in 601.2aâh are completed, effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as itâs cast are applied, then the spell becomes cast. Any abilities that trigger when a spell is cast or put onto the stack trigger at this time. If the spellâs controller had priority before casting it, they get priority.",
    "full_text": "Rule 601.2: To cast a spell is to take it from where it is (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Casting a spell includes proposal of the spell (rules 601.2aâd) and determination and payment of costs (rules 601.2fâh). To cast a spell, a player follows the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legally allowed to cast the spell to begin this process (see rule 601.3). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while performing that step, the casting of the spell is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 732, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ). 601.2a To propose the casting of a spell, a player first moves that card (or that copy of a card) from where it is to the stack. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has all the characteristics of the card (or the copy of a card) associated with it, and that player becomes its controller. Any continuous effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as you start casting it begin as it is put on the stack (see rule 611.2f). The spell remains on the stack until it resolves, itâs countered, or a rule or effect moves it elsewhere. 601.2b If the spell is modal, the player announces the mode choice (see rule 700.2). If the player wishes to splice any cards onto the spell (see rule 702.47), they reveal those cards in their hand. If the spell has alternative or additional costs that will be paid as itâs being cast such as buyback or kicker costs (see rules 118.8 and 118.9), the player announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs (see rule 601.2f). A player canât apply two alternative methods of casting or two alternative costs to a single spell. If the spell has a variable cost that will be paid as itâs being cast (such as an {X} in its mana cost; see rule 107.3), the player announces the value of that variable. If the value of that variable is defined in the text of the spell by a choice that player would make later in the announcement or resolution of the spell, that player makes that choice at this time instead of that later time. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes hybrid mana symbols, the player announces the nonhybrid equivalent cost they intend to pay. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes Phyrexian mana symbols, the player announces whether they intend to pay 2 life or a corresponding colored mana cost for each of those symbols. Previously made choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard or choosing to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the playerâs options when making these choices. 601.2c The player announces their choice of an appropriate object or player for each target the spell requires. A spell may require some targets only if an alternative or additional cost (such as a kicker cost) or a particular mode was chosen for it; otherwise, the spell is cast as though it did not require those targets. Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spellâs text. Once the number of targets the spell has is determined, that number doesnât change, even if the information used to determine the number of targets does. The same target canât be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word âtargetâ on the spell. However, if the spell uses the word âtargetâ in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word âtargetâ (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects that say that an object or player canât be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or players each become a target of that spell. (Any abilities that trigger when those objects and/or players become the target of a spell trigger at this point; theyâll wait to be put on the stack until the spell has finished being cast.) Example: If a spell says âTap two target creatures,â then the same creature canât be chosen twice; the spell requires two different legal targets. A spell that says âDestroy target artifact and target land,â however, can target the same artifact land twice because it uses the word âtargetâ in multiple places. 601.2d If the spell requires the player to divide or distribute an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets, the player announces the division.

It canât be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied.

If any such choices could cause that effect to no longer prohibit that player from casting that spell, the player may begin to cast the spell, ignoring the effect. Example: A player controls Void Winnower, which reads, in part, âYour opponents canât cast spells with even mana values.â That playerâs opponent may begin to cast Rolling Thunder, a card whose mana cost is {X}{R}{R}, because the chosen value of X may cause the spellâs mana value to become odd. 601.3b If an effect allows a player to cast a spell with certain qualities as though it had flash, that player may consider any choices to be made during that spellâs proposal that may cause that spellâs qualities to change. If any such choices could cause that effect to apply, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash. Example: An effect says that you may cast Aura spells as though they had flash, and you have a creature card with bestow in your hand. Because choosing the bestow abilityâs alternative cost causes that spell to become an Aura spell, you may legally begin to cast that spell as though it had flash. 601.3c If an effect allows a player to cast a spell as though it had flash only if an alternative or additional cost is paid, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash. 601.3d If a spell would have flash only if certain conditions are met, its controller may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash if those conditions are met. 601.3e Some rules and effects state that an alternative set of characteristics or a subset of characteristics are considered to determine if a card or copy of a card is legal to cast. These alternative characteristics replace the objectâs characteristics for this determination. Continuous effects that would apply to that object once it has those characteristics are also considered. Example: Garrukâs Horde says, in part, âYou may cast creature spells from the top of your library.â If you control Garrukâs Horde and the top card of your library is a noncreature card with morph, you may cast it using its morph ability. Example: Melek, Izzet Paragon says, in part, âYou may cast instant and sorcery spells from the top of your library.â If you control Melek, Izzet Paragon and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, an adventurer creature card whose Adventure is an instant named Chop Down, you may cast Chop Down but not Giant Killer. If instead you control Garrukâs Horde and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, you may cast Giant Killer but not Chop Down. 601.3f Some effects allow a player to cast a spell with certain qualities from among face-down cards in exile.

During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything.

Example: If an effect reads âAll lands are creaturesâ and a land card is played, the effect makes the land card into a creature the moment it enters the battlefield, so it would trigger abilities that trigger when a creature enters the battlefield.

(Note that if that object left that zone and then returned, itâs a new object and thus wonât be affected. See rule 400.7.) Example: An ability that reads âExile this creature at the beginning of the next end stepâ will exile the permanent even if itâs no longer a creature during the next end step. However, it wonât do anything if the permanent left the battlefield before then. 603.7d If a spell creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is that spell. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that spell as it resolved. 603.7e If an activated or triggered ability creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the source of that other ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that other ability as it resolved. 603.7f If a static ability generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered ability to be created, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the replacement effect was applied. 603.7g If a static ability allows a player to take an action and creates a delayed triggered ability if that player does so, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the action was taken. 603.7h An activated or triggered ability may create a delayed triggered ability that triggers when the ability that created it has resolved a certain number of times in a turn. In that case, that delayed triggered ability is created only once, during the appropriate resolution of that ability."

    "subsection": "608. Resolving Spells and Abilities",
    "content": "If the object thatâs resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell, or an ability, its resolution may involve several steps. The steps described in rules 608.2a and 608.2b are followed first. The steps described in rules 608.2câm are then followed as appropriate, in no specific order. The steps described in rule 608.2n and 608.2p are followed last. 608.2a If a triggered ability has an intervening âifâ clause, it checks whether the clauseâs condition is true. If it isnât, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Otherwise, it continues to resolve. See rule 603.4. 608.2b If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the targets are still legal. A target thatâs no longer in the zone it was in when it was targeted is illegal. Other changes to the game state may cause a target to no longer be legal; for example, its characteristics may have changed or an effect may have changed the text of the spell. If the source of an ability has left the zone it was in, its last known information is used during this process. If all its targets, for every instance of the word âtarget,â are now illegal, the spell or ability doesnât resolve. Itâs removed from the stack and, if itâs a spell, put into its ownerâs graveyard. Otherwise, the spell or ability will resolve normally. Illegal targets, if any, wonât be affected by parts of a resolving spellâs effect for which theyâre illegal. Other parts of the effect for which those targets are not illegal may still affect them. If the spell or ability creates any continuous effects that affect game rules (see rule 613.11), those effects donât apply to illegal targets. If part of the effect requires information about an illegal target, it fails to determine any such information. Any part of the effect that requires that information wonât happen. Example: Sorinâs Thirst is a black instant that reads, âSorinâs Thirst deals 2 damage to target creature and you gain 2 life.â If the creature isnât a legal target during the resolution of Sorinâs Thirst (say, if the creature has gained protection from black or left the battlefield), then Sorinâs Thirst doesnât resolve. Its controller doesnât gain any life. Example: Plague Spores reads, âDestroy target nonblack creature and target land. They canât be regenerated.â Suppose the same creature land is chosen both as the nonblack creature and as the land, and the color of the creature land is changed to black before Plague Spores resolves. Plague Spores still resolves because the black creature land is still a legal target for the âtarget landâ part of the spell. The âdestroy target nonblack creatureâ part of the spell wonât affect that permanent, but the âdestroy target landâ part of the spell will still destroy it. It canât be regenerated. 608.2c The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written. However, replacement effects may modify these actions. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of earlier text (for example, âDestroy target creature. It canât be regeneratedâ or âCounter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, put it on top of its ownerâs library instead of into its ownerâs graveyard.â) Donât just apply effects step by step without thinking in these casesâread the whole text and apply the rules of English to the text. 608.2d If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than choices already made as part of casting the spell, activating the ability, or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player announces these while applying the effect. The player canât choose an option thatâs illegal or impossible, with the exception that having a library with no cards in it doesnât make drawing a card an impossible action (see rule 121.3). If an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. (Note that if an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among some number of target objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack rather than at this time; see rule 601.2d.) Example: A spellâs instruction reads, âYou may sacrifice a creature. If you donât, you lose 4 life.â A player who controls no creatures canât choose the sacrifice option. 608.2e Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses, that involve multiple players. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule 101.4. 608.2f Some spells and abilities include actions taken on multiple players and/or objects. In most cases, each such action is processed simultaneously. If the action canât be processed simultaneously, itâs instead processed considering each affected player or object individually. APNAP order is used to make the primary determination of the order of those actions. Secondarily, if the action is to be taken on both a player and an object they control or on multiple objects controlled by the same player, the player who controls the resolving spell or ability chooses the relative order of those actions. Example: Blatant Thievery says âFor each opponent, gain control of target permanent that player controls.â As Blatant Thievery resolves, its controller gains control of all permanents chosen as targets simultaneously. Example: Soulfire Eruption says, in part, âChoose any number of target creatures, planeswalkers, and/or players. For each of them, exile the top card of your library, then Soulfire Eruption deals damage equal to that cardâs mana value to that permanent or player.â A player casts Soulfire Eruption targeting an opponent and a creature that opponent controls. As Soulfire Eruption resolves, the player canât exile the top card of their library multiple times at the same time, so they first choose which target they are considering, then they exile the top card of their library, and finally Soulfire Eruption deals damage to that target. They then repeat this process for the remaining target. 608.2g If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, they may activate mana abilities before taking that action. If an effect specifically instructs or allows a player to cast a spell during resolution, they do so by following the steps in rules 601.2aâi, except no player receives priority after itâs cast. That spell becomes the topmost object on the stack, and the currently resolving spell or ability continues to resolve, which may include casting other spells this way. No other spells can normally be cast and no other abilities can normally be activated during resolution. 608.2h If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. If the effect requires information from a specific object, including the source of the ability itself, the effect uses the current information of that object if itâs in the public zone it was expected to be in; if itâs no longer in that zone, or if the effect has moved it from a public zone to a hidden zone, the effect uses the objectâs last known information. See rule 113.7a. If an ability states that an object does something, itâs the object as it existsâor as it most recently existedâthat does it, not the ability. 608.2i Some effects look back in time and require information about previous game states and actions rather than considering the current game state. If such an effect requires information from the game about an object or group of objects, and that effect is not taking any actions on those objects, they donât need to be currently in the zone they were in at the time of that previous game state or action, nor do they need to currently meet the criteria described in the action, as long as they did so at the specified time. This is an exception to 608.2h. Example: A player attacks with Bear Cub. Later in the turn, an effect causes Bear Cub to become a noncreature permanent. The same player then casts Search Party Captain, a spell that says in part âThis spell costs {1} less to cast for each creature you attacked with this turn.â That spell costs {1} less because the player attacked with a creature, even though the Bear Cub they attacked with is no longer a creature. 608.2j If an effect refers to certain characteristics, it checks only for the value of the specified characteristics, regardless of any related ones an object may also have. Example: An effect that reads âDestroy all black creaturesâ destroys a white-and-black creature, but one that reads âDestroy all nonblack creaturesâ doesnât. 608.2k If an abilityâs effect refers to a specific untargeted object that has been previously referred to by that abilityâs cost or trigger condition, it still affects that object even if the object has changed characteristics. Example: Wall of Tears says âWhenever this creature blocks a creature, return that creature to its ownerâs hand at end of combat.â If Wall of Tears blocks a creature, then that creature ceases to be a creature before the triggered ability resolves, the permanent will still be returned to its ownerâs hand. 608.2m If an instant spell, sorcery spell, or ability that can legally resolve leaves the stack once it starts to resolve, it will continue to resolve fully. 608.2n As the final part of an instant or sorcery spellâs resolution, the spell is put into its ownerâs graveyard. As the final part of an abilityâs resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to exist. 608.2p Once all possible steps described in 608.2cân are completed, any abilities that trigger when that spell or ability resolves trigger.",
    "full_text": "Rule 608.2: If the object thatâs resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell, or an ability, its resolution may involve several steps. The steps described in rules 608.2a and 608.2b are followed first. The steps described in rules 608.2câm are then followed as appropriate, in no specific order. The steps described in rule 608.2n and 608.2p are followed last. 608.2a If a triggered ability has an intervening âifâ clause, it checks whether the clauseâs condition is true. If it isnât, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Otherwise, it continues to resolve. See rule 603.4. 608.2b If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the targets are still legal. A target thatâs no longer in the zone it was in when it was targeted is illegal. Other changes to the game state may cause a target to no longer be legal; for example, its characteristics may have changed or an effect may have changed the text of the spell. If the source of an ability has left the zone it was in, its last known information is used during this process. If all its targets, for every instance of the word âtarget,â are now illegal, the spell or ability doesnât resolve. Itâs removed from the stack and, if itâs a spell, put into its ownerâs graveyard. Otherwise, the spell or ability will resolve normally. Illegal targets, if any, wonât be affected by parts of a resolving spellâs effect for which theyâre illegal. Other parts of the effect for which those targets are not illegal may still affect them. If the spell or ability creates any continuous effects that affect game rules (see rule 613.11), those effects donât apply to illegal targets. If part of the effect requires information about an illegal target, it fails to determine any such information. Any part of the effect that requires that information wonât happen. Example: Sorinâs Thirst is a black instant that reads, âSorinâs Thirst deals 2 damage to target creature and you gain 2 life.â If the creature isnât a legal target during the resolution of Sorinâs Thirst (say, if the creature has gained protection from black or left the battlefield), then Sorinâs Thirst doesnât resolve. Its controller doesnât gain any life. Example: Plague Spores reads, âDestroy target nonblack creature and target land. They canât be regenerated.â Suppose the same creature land is chosen both as the nonblack creature and as the land, and the color of the creature land is changed to black before Plague Spores resolves. Plague Spores still resolves because the black creature land is still a legal target for the âtarget landâ part of the spell. The âdestroy target nonblack creatureâ part of the spell wonât affect that permanent, but the âdestroy target landâ part of the spell will still destroy it. It canât be regenerated. 608.2c The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written. However, replacement effects may modify these actions. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of earlier text (for example, âDestroy target creature. It canât be regeneratedâ or âCounter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, put it on top of its ownerâs library instead of into its ownerâs graveyard.â) Donât just apply effects step by step without thinking in these casesâread the whole text and apply the rules of English to the text. 608.2d If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than choices already made as part of casting the spell, activating the ability, or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player announces these while applying the effect. The player canât choose an option thatâs illegal or impossible, with the exception that having a library with no cards in it doesnât make drawing a card an impossible action (see rule 121.3). If an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. (Note that if an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among some number of target objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack rather than at this time; see rule 601.2d.) Example: A spellâs instruction reads, âYou may sacrifice a creature. If you donât, you lose 4 life.â A player who controls no creatures canât choose the sacrifice option. 608.2e Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses, that involve multiple players. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule 101.4. 608.2f Some spells and abilities include actions taken on multiple players and/or objects. In most cases, each such action is processed simultaneously. If the action canât be processed simultaneously, itâs instead processed considering each affected player or object individually. APNAP order is used to make the primary determination of the order of those actions. Secondarily, if the action is to be taken on both a player and an object they control or on multiple objects controlled by the same player, the player who controls the resolving spell or ability chooses the relative order of those actions. Example: Blatant Thievery says âFor each opponent, gain control of target permanent that player controls.â As Blatant Thievery resolves, its controller gains control of all permanents chosen as targets simultaneously. Example: Soulfire Eruption says, in part, âChoose any number of target creatures, planeswalkers, and/or players. For each of them, exile the top card of your library, then Soulfire Eruption deals damage equal to that cardâs mana value to that permanent or player.â A player casts Soulfire Eruption targeting an opponent and a creature that opponent controls. As Soulfire Eruption resolves, the player canât exile the top card of their library multiple times at the same time, so they first choose which target they are considering, then they exile the top card of their library, and finally Soulfire Eruption deals damage to that target. They then repeat this process for the remaining target. 608.2g If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, they may activate mana abilities before taking that action. If an effect specifically instructs or allows a player to cast a spell during resolution, they do so by following the steps in rules 601.2aâi, except no player receives priority after itâs cast. That spell becomes the topmost object on the stack, and the currently resolving spell or ability continues to resolve, which may include casting other spells this way. No other spells can normally be cast and no other abilities can normally be activated during resolution. 608.2h If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied.

    "content": "A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or ability. 611.2a A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability lasts as long as stated by the spell or ability creating it (such as âuntil end of turnâ). If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game. 611.2b Some continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability have durations worded âfor as long as . . . .â If the âfor as long asâ duration never starts, the effect does nothing. Similarly, if that duration ends before the moment the effect would first be applied and doesnât begin again during that spell or abilityâs resolution, the effect does nothing. It doesnât start and immediately stop again, and it doesnât last forever. Example: Master Thief has the ability âWhen this creature enters, gain control of target artifact for as long as you control this creature.â If you lose control of Master Thief before the ability resolves, it does nothing, because its durationâas long as you control Master Thiefâwas over before the effect began. 611.2c If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, the set of objects it affects is determined when that continuous effect begins. After that point, the set wonât change. (Note that this works differently than a continuous effect from a static ability.) A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability that doesnât modify the characteristics or change the controller of any objects modifies the rules of the game, so it can affect objects that werenât affected when that continuous effect began. If a single continuous effect has parts that modify the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects and other parts that donât, the set of objects each part applies to is determined independently. Example: An effect that reads âAll white creatures get +1/+1 until end of turnâ gives the bonus to all permanents that are white creatures when the spell or ability resolvesâeven if they change color laterâand doesnât affect those that enter the battlefield or turn white afterward. Example: An effect that reads âPrevent all damage creatures would deal this turnâ doesnât modify any objectâs characteristics, so itâs modifying the rules of the game. That means the effect will apply even to damage from creatures that werenât on the battlefield when the continuous effect began. It also affects damage from permanents that become creatures later in the turn. 611.2d If a resolving spell or ability that creates a continuous effect contains a variable such as X, the value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. See rule 608.2h. 611.2e If a resolving spell or ability both puts a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield and creates a continuous effect stating that the permanent âis [characteristic],â that it âhas [characteristic],â or that it doesnât have a particular characteristic, that continuous effect applies simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. This characteristic is usually a color or a creature type. If the continuous effect says the permanent âbecomes [characteristic]â or âgains [an ability],â that effect applies after the permanent is on the battlefield. Example: Arbiter of the Ideal puts an artifact, creature, or land card onto the battlefield and says, in part, âThat permanent is an enchantment in addition to its other types.â An ability that triggers whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield would trigger. The permanent doesnât enter the battlefield and then become an enchantment. 611.2f Some spells and abilities generate a continuous effect that modifies the characteristics of the next spell a player casts, the next spell that fulfills certain conditions a player casts during some duration, or similar. These effects do not begin immediately. Rather, they begin to apply at the time that player next puts an appropriate spell on the stack, and they apply to that spell. See rule 601.2a.",

Example: Two permanents are on the battlefield.

Example: If a spell attempts to exchange control of two target creatures but one of those creatures is destroyed before the spell resolves, the spell does nothing to the other creature. 701.12b When control of two permanents is exchanged, if those permanents are controlled by different players, each of those players simultaneously gains control of the permanent that was controlled by the other player.

In such cases, the found cards arenât included in the shuffle, even though they remain in the library at that time. Rather, all the cards in that library except those are shuffled. Abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger. See also rule 401, âLibrary.â 701.24c If an effect would cause a player to shuffle one or more specific objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if none of those objects are in the zone theyâre expected to be in or an effect causes all of those objects to be moved to another zone or remain in their current zone. Example: Guile says, in part, âWhen Guile is put into a graveyard from anywhere, shuffle it into its ownerâs library.â Itâs put into a graveyard and its ability triggers, then a player exiles it from that graveyard in response. When the ability resolves, the library is shuffled. Example: Black Sunâs Zenith says, in part, âShuffle Black Sunâs Zenith into its ownerâs library.â Black Sunâs Zenith is in a graveyard, has gained flashback (due to Recoup, perhaps), and is cast from that graveyard. Black Sunâs Zenith will be exiled, and its ownerâs library will be shuffled. 701.24d If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a set of objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if there are no objects in that set. Example: Loaming Shaman says âWhen this creature enters, target player shuffles any number of target cards from their graveyard into their library.â It enters the battlefield, its ability triggers, and no cards are targeted. When the ability resolves, the targeted player will still have to shuffle their library. 701.24e If an effect causes a player to shuffle a library containing zero or one cards, abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger. 701.24f If two or more effects cause a library to be shuffled multiple times simultaneously, abilities that trigger when that library is shuffled will trigger that many times. 701.24g If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a library at the same time that an object would be put into a certain position in that library, the result is a shuffled library thatâs randomized except that the object is in the specified position. Example: Darksteel Colossus and Gravebane Zombie are put into a playerâs graveyard from the battlefield at the same time. Darksteel Colossus says in part âIf Darksteel Colossus would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, reveal Darksteel Colossus and shuffle it into its ownerâs library instead.â Gravebane Zombie says âIf this creature would die, put it on top of its ownerâs library instead.â The player shuffles Darksteel Colossus into their library and puts Gravebane Zombie on top of that library.",

If the quality happens to be a card name, it is treated as such only if the protection ability specifies that the quality is a name. If the quality is a card type, subtype, or supertype, the ability applies to sources that are permanents with that card type, subtype, or supertype and to any sources not on the battlefield that are of that card type, subtype, or supertype.

Once all those blocking creatures are assigned lethal damage, any excess damage is assigned as its controller chooses among those blocking creatures and the player, planeswalker, or battle the creature is attacking.

The attacking creatureâs controller need not assign lethal damage to all those blocking creatures but in that case canât assign any damage to the player or planeswalker itâs attacking. Example: A 2/2 creature that can block an additional creature blocks two attackers: a 1/1 with no abilities and a 3/3 with trample.

    "content": "Phasing 702.26a Phasing is a static ability that modifies the rules of the untap step. During each playerâs untap step, before the active player untaps permanents, all phased-in permanents with phasing that player controls âphase out.â Simultaneously, all phased-out permanents that had phased out under that playerâs control âphase in.â 702.26b If a permanent phases out, its status changes to âphased out.â Except for rules and effects that specifically mention phased-out permanents, a phased-out permanent is treated as though it does not exist. It canât affect or be affected by anything else in the game. A permanent that phases out is removed from combat. (See rule 506.4.) Example: You control three creatures, one of which is phased out. You cast a spell that says âDraw a card for each creature you control.â You draw two cards. Example: You control a phased-out creature. You cast a spell that says âDestroy all creatures.â The phased-out creature is not destroyed. 702.26c If a permanent phases in, its status changes to âphased in.â The game once again treats it as though it exists. 702.26d The phasing event doesnât actually cause a permanent to change zones or control, even though itâs treated as though itâs not on the battlefield and not under its controllerâs control while itâs phased out. Zone-change triggers donât trigger when a permanent phases in or out. Tokens continue to exist on the battlefield while phased out. Counters and stickers remain on a permanent while itâs phased out. Effects that check a phased-in permanentâs history wonât treat the phasing event as having caused the permanent to leave or enter the battlefield or its controllerâs control. 702.26e If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, a phased-out permanent wonât be included in the set of affected objects. This includes continuous effects that reference the permanent specifically, unless they also specifically refer to the permanent as phased out. 702.26f Continuous effects that affect a phased-out permanent may expire while that permanent is phased out. If so, they will no longer affect that permanent once itâs phased in. In particular, effects with âfor as long asâ durations that track that permanent (see rule 611.2b) end when that permanent phases out because they can no longer see it. 702.26g When a permanent phases out, any Auras, Equipment, or Fortifications attached to that permanent phase out at the same time. This alternate way of phasing out is known as phasing out âindirectly.â An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out indirectly wonât phase in by itself, but instead phases in along with the permanent itâs attached to. 702.26h If an object would simultaneously phase out directly and indirectly, it just phases out indirectly. 702.26i An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out directly will phase in attached to the object or player it was attached to when it phased out, if that object is still in the same zone or that player is still in the game. If not, that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification phases in unattached. State-based actions apply as appropriate. (See rules 704.5m and 704.5n.) 702.26j Abilities that trigger when a permanent becomes attached or unattached from an object or player donât trigger when that permanent phases in or out. 702.26k Phased-out permanents owned by a player who leaves the game also leave the game. This doesnât cause zone-change abilities to trigger. See rule 800.4. 702.26m If an effect causes a player to skip their untap step, the phasing event simply doesnât occur that turn. 702.26n In a multiplayer game, game rules may cause a phased-out permanent to leave the game or to be exiled once a player leaves the game. (See rules 800.4a and 800.4c.) If a phased-out permanent phased out under the control of a player who has left the game, that permanent phases in during the next untap step after that playerâs next turn would have begun. 702.26p Multiple instances of phasing on the same permanent are redundant.",

This rule does not apply to tokens that are created with their own set of characteristics and enter the battlefield as a copy of a double-faced object due to a replacement effect. Example: Afflicted Deserter is the front face of a double-faced card, and the name of its back face is Werewolf Ransacker. If an effect creates a token that is a copy of that permanent, the token also has the same two faces and can transform. It enters the battlefield with the same face up as the permanent that it is a copy of. Example: Clone is not a double-faced card, so a token that is created as a copy of a Clone is not a double-faced token, even if it enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent due to Cloneâs replacement effect."

    "content": "Copy effects may include modifications or exceptions to the copying process. 707.9a Some copy effects cause the copy to gain an ability as part of the copying process. This ability becomes part of the copiable values for the copy, along with any other abilities that were copied. Example: Quirion Elves enters the battlefield and an Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. The copiable values of the Shapeshifter now match those of the Elves, except that the Shapeshifter also has the ability âWhenever another creature enters, this creature becomes a copy of that creature, except it has this ability.â Then a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Unstable Shapeshifter. The Clone copies the new copiable values of the Shapeshifter, including the ability that the Shapeshifter gave itself when it copied the Elves. 707.9b Some copy effects modify a characteristic as part of the copying process. The final set of values for that characteristic becomes part of the copiable values of the copy. Example: Copy Artifact is an enchantment that reads, âYou may have this enchantment enter as a copy of any artifact on the battlefield, except itâs an enchantment in addition to its other types.â It enters the battlefield as a copy of Juggernaut. The copiable values of the Copy Artifact now match those of Juggernaut with one modification: its types are now artifact, creature, and enchantment. 707.9c Some copy effects specifically state that they donât copy certain characteristics and the affected objects instead retain their original values. Copy effects may also simply state that certain characteristics are not copied. 707.9d When applying a copy effect that doesnât copy a certain characteristic, retains one or more original values for a certain characteristic, or provides a specific set of values for a certain characteristic, any characteristic-defining ability (see rule 604.3) of the object being copied that defines that characteristic is not copied. If that characteristic is color, any color indicator (see rule 204) of that object is also not copied. This rule does not apply to copy effects with exceptions that state the object is a certain card type, supertype, and/or subtype âin addition to its other types.â In those cases, any characteristic-defining ability that defines card type, supertype, and/or subtype is copied. Example: Quicksilver Gargantuan is a creature that reads, âYou may have this creature enter as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except itâs 7/7.â Quicksilver Gargantuan enters the battlefield as a copy of Tarmogoyf, which has a characteristic-defining ability that defines its power and toughness. Quicksilver Gargantuan does not have that ability. It will be 7/7. Example: Glasspool Mimic is a creature that reads âYou may have this creature enter as a copy of a creature you control, except itâs a Shapeshifter Rogue in addition to its other types.â Glasspool Mimic enters as a copy of a creature with changeling. Glasspool Mimic will have changeling and will have all creature types. 707.9e Some replacement effects that generate copy effects include an exception thatâs an additional effect rather than a modification of the affected objectâs characteristics. If another copy effect is applied to that object after applying the copy effect with that exception, the exceptionâs effect doesnât happen. Example: Altered Ego reads, âYou may have this creature enter as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it enters with X additional +1/+1 counters on it.â You choose for it to enter the battlefield as a copy of Clone, which reads âYou may have this creature enter as a copy of any creature on the battlefield,â for which no creature was chosen as it entered the battlefield. If you then choose a creature to copy as you apply the replacement effect Altered Ego gains by copying Clone, Altered Egoâs replacement effect wonât cause it to enter the battlefield with any +1/+1 counters on it. 707.9f Some exceptions to the copying process apply only if the copy is or has certain characteristics. To determine whether such an exception applies, consider what the resulting permanentâs characteristics would be if the copy effect were applied without that exception, taking into account any other exceptions that effect includes. Example: Moritte of the Frost says, in part, âYou may have Moritte enter as a copy of a permanent you control, except itâs legendary and snow in addition to its other types and, if itâs a creature, it enters with two additional +1/+1 counters on it and it has changeling.â Moritte of the Frost copies a land that has become a creature until end of turn. It would enter as a noncreature permanent, so it wonât enter with two additional +1+1 counters on it and it wonât have changeling, even if it becomes a creature later in the turn. 707.9g Some replacement effects that generate copy effects are linked to triggered abilities written in the same paragraph. (See rule 603.11.) If another copy effect is applied to that object after applying the copy effect with the linked triggered ability, the ability doesnât trigger.",

    "content": "To copy a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability means to put a copy of it onto the stack; a copy of a spell isnât cast and a copy of an activated ability isnât activated. A copy of a spell or ability copies both the characteristics of the spell or ability and all decisions made for it, including modes, targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative costs. (See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â) Choices that are normally made on resolution are not copied. If an effect of the copy refers to objects used to pay its costs, it uses the objects used to pay the costs of the original spell or ability. A copy of a spell is owned by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell or ability is controlled by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell is itself a spell, even though it has no spell card associated with it. A copy of an ability is itself an ability. Example: A player casts Fork, targeting an Emerald Charm. Fork reads, âCopy target instant or sorcery spell, except that the copy is red. You may choose new targets for the copy.â Emerald Charm is a modal green instant. When the Fork resolves, it puts a copy of the Emerald Charm on the stack except the copy is red, not green. The copy has the same mode that was chosen for the original Emerald Charm. It does not necessarily have the same target, but only because Fork allows choosing of new targets. Example: Fling is an instant that reads, âAs an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creatureâ and âFling deals damage equal to the sacrificed creatureâs power to any target.â When determining how much damage a copy of Fling deals, it checks the power of the creature sacrificed to pay for the original Fling. Example: Dawnglow Infusion is a sorcery that reads, âYou gain X life if {G} was spent to cast this spell and X life if {W} was spent to cast it.â Because mana isnât an object, a copy of Dawnglow Infusion wonât cause you to gain any life, no matter what mana was spent to cast the original spell. 707.10a If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. If a copy of a card is in any zone other than the stack or the battlefield, it ceases to exist. These are state-based actions. See rule 704. 707.10b A copy of an ability has the same source as the original ability. If the ability refers to its source by name, the copy refers to that same object and not to any other object with the same name. The copy is considered to be the same ability by effects that count how many times that ability has resolved during the turn. 707.10c Some effects copy a spell or ability and state that its controller may choose new targets for the copy. The player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal. Once the player has decided what the copyâs targets will be, the copy is put onto the stack with those targets. 707.10d Some effects copy a spell or ability for each player or object it âcould target.â The copies are put onto the stack with those targets in the order of their controllerâs choice. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of its targets must be the same player or object. If that player or object isnât a legal target for each instance of the word âtarget,â a copy isnât created for that player or object. 707.10e Some effects copy a spell or ability and specify a new target for the copy. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of the copyâs targets must be that player or object. If that player or object isnât a legal target for each instance of the word âtarget,â the copy isnât created. In the case where a replacement effect causes the copy to target more than one object, the copyâs controller chooses one of them to be the new target. The chosen target must be a legal target for that spell or ability. Example: Frontline Heroism is an enchantment with the ability âWhenever you cast a spell that targets only a single creature you control, create a 1/1 red Soldier creature token with haste, then copy that spell. The copy targets that token.â Anointed Procession is an enchantment with the ability âIf an effect would create one or more tokens under your control, it creates twice that many of those tokens instead.â If you control both and cast Moment of Triumph targeting a creature you control, Frontline Heroismâs ability triggers. As that ability resolves, you create two 1/1 red Soldier creature tokens with haste, then copy Moment of Triumph and the copy targets one of those tokens of your choice. The copy doesnât target both the tokens. 707.10f Some effects copy a permanent spell. As that copy resolves, it ceases being a copy of a spell and becomes a token permanent. (See rule 608.3f.) 707.10g If an effect creates a copy of a double-faced permanent spell, the copy is also a double-faced permanent spell that has both a front face and a back face. The characteristics of its front and back face are determined by the copiable values of the same face of the spell it is a copy of, as modified by any other copy effects. If the spell it is a copy of has its back face up, the copy is created with its back face up. The token thatâs put onto the battlefield as that spell resolves is a double-faced token.",

An ability that triggers âwhenever a card is put into a graveyard from anywhereâ triggers twice. 712.21a If a melded permanent is put into its ownerâs graveyard or library, that player may arrange the two cards in any order. If itâs put into its ownerâs library, that player doesnât reveal the order. 712.21b If a player exiles a melded permanent, that player determines the relative timestamp order of the two cards at that time. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 613.7m.

(See rule 400.7.) If that effect causes actions to be taken upon those cards, the same actions are taken upon each of them. Example: Otherworldly Journey is an instant that reads âExile target creature. At the beginning of the next end step, return that card to the battlefield under its ownerâs control with a +1/+1 counter on it.â A player casts Otherworldly Journey targeting Chittering Host, a melded permanent. Chittering Host is exiled. At the beginning of the next end step, Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats are both returned to the battlefield, each with a +1/+1 counter on it. Example: False Demise is an Aura with the ability âWhen enchanted creature dies, return that card to the battlefield under your control.â A Chittering Host enchanted by False Demise dies. The triggered ability returns both Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats to the battlefield. Example: Mimic Vat is an artifact that reads, in part, âWhenever a nontoken creature dies, you may exile that card.â A Chittering Host dies.

If the melded permanent is a commander, it may be exempt from this rule; see rules 903.9bâc. Example: Leyline of the Void is an enchantment that reads, in part, âIf a card would be put into an opponentâs graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.â Wheel of Sun and Moon is an Aura with enchant player and the ability âIf a card would be put into enchanted playerâs graveyard from anywhere, instead that card is revealed and put on the bottom of its ownerâs library.â If the controller of Chittering Host is affected by both cardsâ effects, that player chooses one effect to apply to the event and Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats are both moved to the appropriate zone. 712.21e If an effect needs to know the number of objects that changed zones, a melded permanent among those objects counts as one object that moved.

Example: The active player draws a card during her draw step, then says, âGo.â The nonactive player is holding Into the Fray (an instant that says âTarget creature attacks this turn if ableâ) and says, âIâd like to cast a spell during your beginning of combat step.â The current proposed shortcut is that all players pass priority at all opportunities during the turn until the nonactive player has priority during the beginning of combat step. 731.2c Once the last player has either accepted or shortened the shortcut proposal, the shortcut is taken.

Example: The active player draws a card during her draw step, then says, âGo.â The nonactive player is holding Into the Fray (an instant that says âTarget creature attacks this turn if ableâ) and says, âIâd like to cast a spell during your beginning of combat step.â The current proposed shortcut is that all players pass priority at all opportunities during the turn until the nonactive player has priority during the beginning of combat step. 731.2c Once the last player has either accepted or shortened the shortcut proposal, the shortcut is taken. The game advances to the last proposed ending point, with all game choices contained in the shortcut proposal having been taken. If the shortcut was shortened from the original proposal, the player who now has priority must make a different game choice than what was originally proposed for that player."

    "content": "Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game. 800.4a When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule 109) owned by that player leave the game and any effects which give that player control of any objects or players end. Then, if that player controlled any objects on the stack not represented by cards, those objects cease to exist. Then, if there are any objects still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game. If the player who left the game had priority at the time they left, priority passes to the next player in turn order whoâs still in the game. Example: Alex casts Mind Control, an Aura that reads, âYou control enchanted creature,â on Biancaâs Assault Griffin. If Alex leaves the game, so does Mind Control, and Assault Griffin reverts to Biancaâs control. If, instead, Bianca leaves the game, so does Assault Griffin, and Mind Control is put into Alexâs graveyard. Example: Alex casts Act of Treason, which reads, in part, âGain control of target creature until end of turn,â targeting Biancaâs Runeclaw Bears. If Alex leaves the game, Act of Treasonâs change-of-control effect ends and Runeclaw Bears reverts to Biancaâs control. Example: Alex casts Bribery, which reads, âSearch target opponentâs library for a creature card and put that card onto the battlefield under your control. Then that player shuffles their library,â targeting Bianca. Alex puts Serra Angel onto the battlefield from Biancaâs library. If Bianca leaves the game, Serra Angel also leaves the game. If, instead, Alex leaves the game, Serra Angel is exiled. Example: Alex controls Genesis Chamber, which reads, âWhenever a nontoken creature enters, if Genesis Chamber is untapped, that creatureâs controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.â If Alex leaves the game, all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under Alexâs control leave the game, and all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under any other playerâs control remain in the game. 800.4b If an object would change to the control of a player who has left the game, it doesnât. If a token would be created under the control of a player who has left the game, no token is created. If an object would be put onto the battlefield or onto the stack under the control of a player who has left the game, that object remains in its current zone. If a player would be controlled by a player who has left the game, they arenât. 800.4c If an effect that gives a player still in the game control of an object ends, there is no other effect giving control of that object to another player in the game, and the player who controlled that object by default has left the game, the object is exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the control-changing effect ends. 800.4d If an object that would be owned by a player who has left the game would be created in any zone, it isnât created. If a triggered ability that would be controlled by a player who has left the game would be put onto the stack, it isnât put on the stack. Example: Astral Slide is an enchantment that reads, âWhenever a player cycles a card, you may exile target creature. If you do, return that creature to the battlefield under its ownerâs control at the beginning of the next end step.â During Alexâs turn, Bianca uses Astral Slideâs ability to exile Alexâs Hypnotic Specter. Before the end of that turn, Bianca leaves the game. At the beginning of the end step, the delayed triggered ability generated by Astral Slide that would return Hypnotic Specter to the battlefield triggers, but it isnât put on the stack. Hypnotic Specter never returns to the battlefield. 800.4e If combat damage would be assigned to a player who has left the game, that damage isnât assigned. 800.4f If an object requires a player who has left the game to pay a cost or choose whether to pay a cost, that cost is not paid. 800.4g If an object requires a player who has left the game to make a choice other than whether to pay a cost, the controller of the object chooses another player to make that choice. If the original choice was to be made by an opponent of the controller of the object, that player chooses another opponent if possible. 800.4h If a rule requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the next player in turn order makes that choice. 800.4i If an effect requires information about a specific player, the effect uses the current information about that player if they are still in the game; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information about that player before they left the game. If an effect requires information from the game about actions players have taken, the effect can find actions that were taken by a player who has left the game. 800.4j If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues to its completion without an active player. If the active player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order receives priority, or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase or step ends, whichever is appropriate. 800.4k If a player who has left the game would begin a turn, that turn doesnât begin. 800.4m When a player leaves the game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that playerâs next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely. 800.4n When a player leaves the game, objects that player owns in the ante zone do not leave the game. This is an exception to rule 800.4a. See rule 407, âAnte.â 800.4p In a Planechase game, if the player designated as the planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldnât leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game.

    "content": "Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of influence option is used. 801.5a If a player is asked to choose an object or player, they must choose one within their range of influence. Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Alex activates the ability of Cuombajj Witches, which reads, â{T}: Cuombajj Witches deals 1 damage to any target and 1 damage to any target of an opponentâs choice,â targeting Rob and choosing Rob as the opponent who picks the other target. Rob must choose a target thatâs in both his range of influence and in the range of influence of the controller of Cuombajj Witches. He must therefore choose himself, Alex, or a creature controlled by either himself or Alex. 801.5b If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not between one or more objects or players), they can choose between those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside the playerâs range of influence. Example: Alex, who has a range of influence of 2, is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa, who has a range of influence of 1, is seated to the right of Rob. Alex casts a spell that reads, âAn opponent chooses one â You draw two cards; or each creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn,â and chooses Carissa to make that choice. Carissa can choose the mode even though Alex is out of her range. 801.5c If an effect requires a choice and thereâs no player who can make that choice within its controllerâs range of influence, the closest appropriate player to its controllerâs left makes that choice. Example: In an Emperor game in which all players have range of influence 1, an emperor casts Fact or Fiction, which reads, âReveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.â Since no opponent is within the emperorâs range of influence, the nearest opponent to the emperorâs left separates the cards into piles.",

A game with fifteen players has three turn markers. 807.4b The starting player in the game gets the first turn marker. The player four seats to that playerâs left (the fifth player) takes the second turn marker, and so on until all the turn markers have been handed out. Each turn marker is assigned a number in this way. Then all players with turn markers start their turns at the same time. 807.4c After a player ends their turn, that player passes the turn marker to the player on their left. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game during their turn, the player to their left takes the turn marker after that turn ends. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game before their turn begins, the player to their left takes the turn marker immediately. 807.4d A player who receives a turn marker canât begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. 807.4e If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed playerâs right is designated for removal. If more than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest number is designated for removal. A turn marker may be designated for removal multiple times. 807.4f For the purposes of determining if one or more players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game (see rule 807.4e), disregard turn markers already designated for removal. 807.4g If a player whoâs taking a turn has a turn marker thatâs been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends. If a player whoâs not taking a turn has a turn marker thatâs been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed immediately. If a removed turn marker had been designated for removal multiple times, the turn marker to its right becomes designated for removal that many times minus one. 807.4h If one or more consecutively seated players leave the game, the players that were on either side of those seats donât enter one anotherâs range of influence until the next turn begins. 807.4i If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra turn after the current one, that player keeps the turn marker and starts their next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn marker is too close on either side at that time. If a turn marker is within three seats on the playerâs left, the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn marker is within three seats on the playerâs right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn. 807.4j If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player wouldnât have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn instead. Example: During Alexâs turn, he casts Time Walk, which causes him to take an extra turn after this one. During the same turn, the player to Alexâs left leaves the game, which causes the number of turn markers to be reduced. After Alexâs current turn ends, his turn marker is removed.

If a player with a turn marker leaves the game during their turn, the player to their left takes the turn marker after that turn ends. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game before their turn begins, the player to their left takes the turn marker immediately. 807.4d A player who receives a turn marker canât begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. 807.4e If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed playerâs right is designated for removal. If more than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest number is designated for removal. A turn marker may be designated for removal multiple times. 807.4f For the purposes of determining if one or more players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game (see rule 807.4e), disregard turn markers already designated for removal. 807.4g If a player whoâs taking a turn has a turn marker thatâs been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends. If a player whoâs not taking a turn has a turn marker thatâs been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed immediately. If a removed turn marker had been designated for removal multiple times, the turn marker to its right becomes designated for removal that many times minus one. 807.4h If one or more consecutively seated players leave the game, the players that were on either side of those seats donât enter one anotherâs range of influence until the next turn begins. 807.4i If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra turn after the current one, that player keeps the turn marker and starts their next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn marker is too close on either side at that time. If a turn marker is within three seats on the playerâs left, the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn marker is within three seats on the playerâs right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn. 807.4j If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player wouldnât have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn instead. Example: During Alexâs turn, he casts Time Walk, which causes him to take an extra turn after this one. During the same turn, the player to Alexâs left leaves the game, which causes the number of turn markers to be reduced. After Alexâs current turn ends, his turn marker is removed. He wonât take the extra turn from Time Walk until just before his normal turn the next time he receives a turn marker."

    "content": "Commander Draft 903.13a Commander Draft is an option for a different style of Commander game. It consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Commander Draft option uses Commander Legends booster packs by default. 903.13b A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts two cards by placing them in a face-down pile in front of them, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts two cards from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted. 903.13c In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each playerâs left. In the second draft round, booster packs are passed to each playerâs right. 903.13d During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting from and cards they have already drafted. A player may not reveal drafted cards to other players unless an ability instructs them to. 903.13e After the draft is complete, the cards a player drafted become that playerâs card pool. If the draft contained draft boosters from Commander Legends or Commander Masters, each player may add up to two cards named The Prismatic Piper to their card pool, but only if those cards are used as the playerâs commander(s). If the draft contained draft boosters from Commander Legends: Battle for Baldurâs GateÂ®, each player may add up to two cards named Faceless One to their card pool, but only if those cards are used as the playerâs commander(s). 903.13f Commander Draft deck construction follows the same rules as Commander deck construction (see rule 903.5) with three exceptions: (1) A playerâs deck must contain at least 60 cards. There is no maximum deck size. (2) A playerâs deck may include any number of cards from that playerâs card pool with the same name. (3) If the draft contained draft boosters from Commander Masters, any card which can be a playerâs commander by itself and whose color identity includes one or fewer colors is considered to have the partner ability for the purposes of deckbuilding. (See rule 702.124, âPartner.â) 903.13g Commander Draft games follow the same rules as Commander games. See rules 903.6â903.11.",
